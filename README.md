This project is a custom implementation of a car configurator challenge inspired by Brad Traversy. It is a Single Page Application (SPA) built using Vanilla JavaScript that allows users to customize a vehicle and see
real-time price updates and visual changes.
Rather than following a tutorial step-by-step, I built this project independently to strengthen my DOM manipulation and logic-building skills.
One of the most challenging parts of this project was synchronizing the rendering logic for the car image. I had to ensure that the color and the wheel selection (standard vs. performance) merged correctly into 
a single file path string.
Made with
- Semantic HTML5,
- CSS Grid & Flexbox,
- CSS Variables & custom properties,
- Vanilla JS
